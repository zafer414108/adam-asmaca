Your HTML structure for the "Adam Asmaca" (Hangman) game looks well-organized. Here are some observations:

# Meta Tags:

You've included necessary meta tags for character set, viewport settings, and compatibility.
# Stylesheet Link:

You have linked an external stylesheet (style.css) for styling. Ensure that this file exists and contains the necessary styles for your game.
# Title Tag:

The title tag is appropriately set to "Adam Asmaca."
# Header Section:

The <h1> element with "Adam Asmaca" serves as the main heading for your game.
The paragraph <p> element provides a brief instruction for the player.
# SVG Graphic:

The SVG graphic is used to draw the hangman figure. It's a creative way to visualize the game progress.
Each part of the hangman figure is drawn using lines and circles.
# Word and Wrong Letters Containers:

The <div> elements with the IDs "word" and "wrong-letters" are presumably used to display the word to guess and the wrong letters entered by the player.
# Popup Container:

You have a popup container with a message for winning the game and a "Tekrar Oyna" (Play Again) button. This is a nice addition for user interaction.
# Message Container:

The <div> with the ID "message" seems to be intended for displaying messages such as informing the user that they have already entered a specific letter.
# Script Tag:

You've included a script tag pointing to "script.js." Ensure that this file exists and contains the necessary JavaScript logic for your hangman game.
# Popup and Message Elements:

You might want to add styles or hide the popup and message elements initially, displaying them only when needed during the game.
# Semantic HTML:

Your use of semantic HTML elements is good, making the structure clear and accessible.

Ensure that the associated CSS and JavaScript files (style.css and script.js) are implemented correctly to provide the necessary styling and functionality for your Hangman game. Overall, it looks like a fun and well-structured game!
